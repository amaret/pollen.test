Trying to find the composition inheritance bug I came up with this. 


module M {
  public foo() {}
  public bar() {}
}
------
import M as N   
composition C1 {
  export N.foo
}
------
import C1  
composition C10 extends C1 { 
  export C1.bar     // BADTEST because C1.bar is not available for export. 
}                   // the error here: 'exported function not found."
------
import C10 as Z 
import C10 
# TEST Use extends to resolve
# TEST P.foo should not resolve
module Test9 {
  test() {
    Z.foo() # resolves via extends
    Z.bar()
    C10.foo() # resolves via extends
    C10.bar()
  }
  pollen.run() { }
}
